<h1>Improve Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting For A Small Business</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>

In this activity, I was asked to assess the access controls used by a business after going through the following scenario:

You’re the first cybersecurity professional hired by a growing business.

Recently, a deposit was made from the business to an unknown bank account. The finance manager says they didn’t make a mistake. Fortunately, they were able to stop the payment. The owner has asked you to investigate what happened to prevent any future incidents.

To do this, you’ll need to do some accounting on the incident to better understand what happened. First, you will review the access log of the incident. Next, you will take notes that can help you identify a possible threat actor. Then, you will spot issues with the access controls that were exploited by the user. Finally, you will recommend mitigations that can improve the business' access controls and reduce the likelihood that this incident reoccurs.

After reviewing the scenario and access logs, I took notes that helped me identify the threat actor. Thereafter, I identified issues with access controls, i.e. Robert Taylor Jr., who was a legal attorney for the firm in 2019, accessed payroll systems in 2023.

In the end, I recommended that:

1 . User accounts should expire 30 days after they have left the organisation;
2. Access granted to contractors should be limited to the scope of the contract;
3. Multi-Factor Authorization should be used to allow access to only authorized personnel.
